I have a love/hate relationship with VsCode snippets. On one hand, they are wonderful time saving mechanisms that provide a ton of consistent value. On the other hand, I can never remember the shortcuts and end up with a laundry list of unhelpful acronyms in the autocomplete panel that I'm unsure how to use.

VsCode has a lot of helpful snippet libraries available as extensions. A few of note I have used in the past are Turbo Console Log and ES7 Snippets. Turbo Console Log is pretty wonderful but I find when I leverage these plugins a few things consistently happen:

1. I only use 1 or two snippets from the entire library, cause that's all I can confidently remember what they contain.
1. When I use the snippet, I typically have to do amendments to the code it gives me. Sometimes these amendments take longer than writing the code manually.
1. In the case of Turbo Console Log, sometimes it inserts the log statements in a place it can't correctly run. These tiny mishaps cause me to write my log statement manually and I never build muscle memory for using the snippet.

I think the snippet I use more than any other is a very poor one I wrote for `console.log`. Recently I decided to try a couple different approaches to improve it and see which work best for me in practice and why.

## Important Usability Improvements

As I have been writing, researching and dogfooding for this article I discovered there are a few very important changes to consider making that will greatly improve your experience with snippets in general inside VsCode. These are important to consider before diving into the approaches.

### 1. Cleanup current autocomplete options

Admittedly, part of the problems I describe above (of feeling overwhelmed with snippet options) is because initially VsCode includes snippet options from a lot of different places I didn't intentionally set up.

### 2. Snippet Keyboard Shortcuts

### 3. Global Snippets

### 4. Snippet Suggestion Priority

### 5. Include Autcomplete Arguments in Snippet Text

This one blew my mind. It essentially turn your snippet into a function with whatever precedes it.
