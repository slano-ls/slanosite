# ðŸ‘‹ rossmoody.com

The website and blog for [rossmoody.com](https://rossmoody.com). This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Feel free to fork this repo. I would prefer if your site didn't look identical, but if it does I'll take it as a compliment, not a sleight.

## Getting started

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rossmoody/rossmoody.com
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd rossmoody.com
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  yarn
```

Start the server

```bash
  yarn dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> with your browser to see the result.
